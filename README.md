## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I will start with the style-guide.md file. Then I will try to gauge what fonts were used in which areas awhile making my --custom properties.

I had fun making this project, at first I wanted to just try using only Grid but instead opted on Flex for mobile and then Grid for desktop.

I also got to try Prettier for the first time, I enjoy its formatting compared to VS Code's default formatter. :)

My first issue was when I was styling the cards, I noticed once I shrinked my width lower than `375px`, my header would cut off at the top and only half would show, this was an issue I have had before and I am not sure what is the best solution to do, it seems like an obvious reason but I have not had much luck when researching it.

My solution was to add `margin: 15rem` to the `body` but I can't tell if this is not good practice with how much it is and anyone seeing that makes their eye twitch!

For the border color, I noticed after researching how to achieve a top border color, some people use a pseudo element with positioning but I learned about the `border-top-color` property and it did what I wanted, granted the color leaks into the side-corners a tiny bit, I am not sure if there was a way to stop that. 

I also got to try a bit of `grid-area` too, I feel like I am not fully confident in utilizing grid as well as I want to, so this project has told me to do more research on all of grid's properties.
